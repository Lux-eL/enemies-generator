# Random Monsters Generator
This is part of an incomplete project I was working on.
The original idea was the creation of a rogue-like web game, with a system for the random generation of the monsters found inside the dungeon. Each monster, based on the appearance, had different stats and features.

The generator is actually really simple, it's a javascript code that randomly picks parts of the monsters and mesh them up together with a random color. The parts that make up a monster are:
- head shape
- eyes
- mouth (or, more correctly, jaw)
